# Univariate vs Multivariate Regression Models

.content-box-green[**Univariate**]

The most important assumption $E[u|x] = 0$ (zero conditional mean) is almost always violated (unless you data comes from randomized experiments) because all the other variables are sitting in the error term, which can be correlated with $x$.

.content-box-green[**Multivariate**]

More independent variables mean less factors left in the error term, which makes the endogeneity problem <span style = "color: blue;"> less </span>severe

---
class: middle

.content-box-green[**Bi-variate vs. Uni-variate**]
  
\begin{aligned}
  \mbox{Bi-variate}\;\; wage = & \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + \beta_2 exper + u_2 \\
  \mbox{Uni-variate}\;\; wage = & \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + u_1 (=u_2+\beta_2 exper)
\end{aligned}

.content-box-green[**What's different?**]

+ **bi-variate**: able to measure the effect of education on wage, <span style = "color: blue;"> holding experience fixed </span> because experience is modeled explicitly (<span style = "color: red;"> We say $exper$ is controlled for. </span>)

+ **uni-variate**: $\hat{\beta_1}$ is biased unless experience is uncorrelated with education because experience was in error term

class: middle

.content-box-green[**Another example**]

The impact of per student spending (`expend`) on standardized test score (`avgscore`) at the high school level

\begin{aligned}
avgscore= & \beta_0+\beta_1 expend + u_1 (=u_2+\beta_2 avginc) \notag \\
avgscore= & \beta_0+\beta_1 expend +\beta_2 avginc + u_2 \notag

# Model with two independent variables

More generally,

\begin{aligned}
  y=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + u
\end{aligned}

+ $\beta_0$: intercept
+ $\beta_1$: measure the change in $y$ with respect to $x_1$, holding other factors fixed
+ $\beta_2$: measure the change in $y$ with respect to $x_1$, holding other factors fixed

# The Crucial Condition (Assumption) for Unbiasedness of the OLS Estimator

.content-box-green[**Uni-variate**]

For $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + u$, 

$E[u|x]=0$

<br>

.content-box-green[**Bi-variate**]

For $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + u$, 

+ Mathematically: $E[u|x_1,x_2]=0$
+ Verbally: for any values of $x_1$ and $x_2$, the expected value of the unobservables is zero

class: middle

.content-box-green[**Mean independence condition: example**] 

In the following wage model,

\begin{aligned}
  wage = & \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + \beta_2 exper + u
\end{aligned}

Mean independence condition is

\begin{aligned}
  E[u|educ,exper]=0
\end{aligned}

**Verbally**: this condition would be satisfied if innate ability of students is on average unrelated to education level and experience.

# The model with $k$ independent variables

.content-box-green[**Model**]

\begin{aligned}
  y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_k x_k + u
\end{aligned}

.content-box-green[**Mean independence assumption?**]  

$\beta_{OLS}$ (OLS estimators of $\beta$s) is unbiased if,

\begin{aligned}
    E[u|x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k]=0
\end{aligned}

**Verbally**: this condition would be satisfied if the error term is uncorrelated wtih any of the independent variables, $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k$.

# Deriving OLS estimators

.content-box-green[**OLS**]

Find the combination of $\beta$s that minimizes the sum of squared residuals

.content-box-green[**So,**]

Denoting the collection of $\hat{\beta}$s as $\hat{\theta} (=\{\hat{\beta_0},\hat{\beta_1},\dots,\hat{\beta_k}\})$,

\begin{aligned}

# Frisch–Waugh–Lovell Theorem

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1000px></html>

---
class: middle

Consider the following simple model,

\begin{aligned}
  y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,i} + \beta_2 x_{2,i} + \beta_3 x_{3,i} + u_i
\end{aligned}

Suppose you are interested in estimating only $\beta_1$.

---
class: middle

Let's consider the following two methods,

.content-box-green[**Method 1: Regular OLS**]

Regress $y$ on $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ with an intercept to estimate $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, $\beta_3$ at the same time (just like you normally do)

.content-box-green[**Method 2: 3-step**]

+ regress $y$ on $x_2$ and $x_3$ with an intercept and get residuals, which we call $\hat{u}_y$
+ regress $x_1$ on $x_2$ and $x_3$ with an intercept and get residuals, which we call $\hat{u}_{x_1}$
+ regress $\hat{u}_y$ on $\hat{u}_{x_1}$ $(\hat{u}_y=\alpha_1 \hat{u}_{x_1}+v_3)$

.content-box-green[**Frisch-Waugh–Lovell theorem**]

Methods 1 and 2 produces the same coefficient estimate on $x_1$

$$\hat{\beta_1} = \hat{\alpha_1}$$

---
class: middle

# Partialing out Interpretation from Method 2

.content-box-green[**Step 1**]

Regress $y$ on $x_2$ and $x_3$ with an intercept and get residuals, which we call $\hat{u}_y$

+ $\hat{u}_y$ is void of the impact of $x_2$ and $x_3$ on $y$

.content-box-green[**Step 2**]

Regress $x_1$ on $x_2$ and $x_3$ with an intercept and get residuals, which we call $\hat{u}_{x_1}$

+ $\hat{u}_{x_1}$ is void of the impact of $x_2$ and $x_3$ on $x_1$

.content-box-green[**Step 3**]

Regress $\hat{u}_y$ on $\hat{u}_{x_1}$, which produces an estimte of $\beta_1$ that is identical to that you can get from regressin $y$ on $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$

---
class: middle

# Interpretation

+ Regressing $y$ on all explanatory variables $(x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3)$ in a multivariate regression is as if you are looking at the impact of a single explanatory variable with the effects of all the other effects partiled out

+ In other words, including variables beyond your variable of interest lets you <span style = "color: red;"> control for (remove the effect of) </span> other variables, avoiding confusing the impact of the variable of interest with the impact of other variables.

# Perfect Collinearity

.content-box-green[**No Perfect Collinearity**]

Any variable cannot be a linear function of the other variables

# Variance of the OLS estimators

.content-box-green[**Homoeskedasticity**]

\begin{aligned}
Var(u|x_1,\dots,x_k)=\sigma^2 \;\;\mbox{(Assumption MLR.5)}
\end{aligned}

<br>

.content-box-green[**Variance of the OLS estimator**]

Under conditions $MLR.1$ through $MLR.5$, conditional on the sample values of the independent variables,

\begin{aligned}
    Var(\hat{\beta}_j)= \frac{\sigma^2}{SST_j(1-R^2_j)},
\end{aligned}

where $SST_j= \sum_{i=1}^n (x_{ji}-\bar{x_j})^2$ and $R_j^2$ is the R-squared from regressing $x_j$ on all other independent variables including an intercept. (<span style = "color: blue;"> We will revisit this equation</span>)

---
class: middle

# Estimating $\sigma^2$

Just like uni-variate regression, you need to estimate $\sigma^2$ if you want to estimate the variance (and standard deviation) of the OLS estimators.

.content-box-green[**uni-variate regression**]
\begin{aligned}
  \hat{\sigma}^2=\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\hat{u}_i^2}{n-2}
\end{aligned}

.content-box-green[**multi-variate regression**]

A model with $k$ independent variables with intercept.

\begin{aligned}
  \hat{\sigma}^2=\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\hat{u}_i^2}{n-(k+1)}
\end{aligned}

You solved $k+1$ simultaneous equations to get $\hat{\beta}_j$ $(j=0,\dots,k)$. So, once you know the value of $n-k-1$ of the residuals, you know the rest.

---
class: middle

The <span style = "color: red;"> estimator </span> of the variance of the OLS estimator is therefore

$$
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{Var{\hat{\beta}_j}} = \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{SST_j(1-R^2_j)}
\end{aligned}
$$
