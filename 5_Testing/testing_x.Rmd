# Hypothesis Testing: General Steps

Here is the general step of any hypothesis testing:

+ Step 1: specify the null $(H_0)$ and alternative $(H_1)$ hypotheses

+ Step 2: find the distribution of the test statistic .red[if the null hypothesis is true]

+ Step 3: calculate the test statistic based on the data and regression results

+ Step 4: define the significance level

+ Step 5: check how unlikely that you get the actual test statistic (found at Step 3) .red[if indeed the null hypothesis is true]

# Hypothesis testing: An Example

.content-box-green[**Goal**]

Suppose you want to test if the expected value of a normally distributed random variable $(x)$ is 1 or not.

<br>

.content-box-green[**State of Knowledge**]

We do know $x$ follows a normal distribution and its variance is 4 for some reason.

<br>

.content-box-green[**Your Estimator**]

Your estimator is the sample mean: $\theta = \sum_{i=1}^J x_i/J$

---
class: middle

# Math Asides

.content-box-red[**Math Aside 1**]

$Var(ax) = a^2 Var(X)$

So, we know that $\theta \sim N(\alpha, 4/J)$ (of course $\alpha$ is not known).

<br>

.content-box-red[**Math Aside 2**]

If $x \sim N(a, b)$, then, 

$x-a \sim N(0, b)$ (shift) 

Further,

$\frac{x-a}{\sqrt{b}} \sim N(0, 1)$ (see Math Aside 1)

---
class: middle

.content-box-red[**Math Aside 1**]

$Var(ax) = a^2 Var(X)$

<br>

.content-box-red[**Math Aside 2**]

If $x \sim N(a, b)$, then, $\frac{x-a}{\sqrt{b}} \sim N(0, 1)$ (see Math Aside 1)

.content-box-green[**Therefore,**]

Since $\theta = \sum_{i=1}^J x_i/J$ and $x_i \sim N(\alpha, 4)$,

$Var(\theta) = J \times \frac{1}{J^2}Var(x) = 4/J$

$\frac{\sqrt{J}}{2} \cdot (\theta - \alpha)\sim N(0, 1)$.

---
class: middle

.content-box-red[**Test statistic and its distribution under the null hypothesis**]

We established that $\frac{\sqrt{J}}{2} \cdot (\theta - \alpha)\sim N(0, 1)$.

The null hypothesis is $\alpha = 1$. 

If $\alpha = 1$ is indeed true, then $\sqrt{J} \times (\theta - 1)/2 \sim N(0, 1)$.

In other words, if you multiply the sample mean by the square root of the number of observations and divide it by 2, then it follows the standard normal distribution like below.

```{r echo = F, out.width = "50%"}
x <- seq(-4, 4, length = 1000)
y <- dnorm(x, sd = 1)
plot_data <- data.table(x = x, y = y)
ggplot(data = plot_data) +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y), color = "black")
```

class: middle

# Hypothesis testing: An Example (Cont.)

```{r echo = F, out.width = "50%"}
x <- seq(-4, 4, length = 1000)
y <- dnorm(x, sd = 1)
plot_data <- data.table(x = x, y = y)
ggplot(data = plot_data) +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y), color = "black")
```

--

.content-box-red[**Case 1**]

Suppose you have obtained 100 samples $(J = 100)$ and calculated $\theta$ (sample mean), which turned out to be 2.

Then, your test statistic is $\sqrt{100} \times (2-1)/2 = 5$.

How unlikely is it to get the number you got (5) if the null hypothesis is indeed true?

--

.blue[Very unlikely! So, the null is very much likely wrong!]

--

.content-box-red[**Case 2**]

Suppose you have obtained 400 samples $(J = 400)$ and calculated $\theta$ (sample mean), which turned out to be 1.02.

Then, your test statistic is $\sqrt{400} \times (1.02-1)/2 = 0.2$.

How unlikely is it to get the number you got (0.2) if the null hypothesis is indeed true?

--

.blue[Very much possible! So, we cannot say confidently that the null is wrong.]

---

# Hypothesis testing: Side Note

Note that you do not really need to use $\sqrt{J} \times (\theta - \alpha)/2$ as your test statistic. 

--

You could alternatively use $\theta - \alpha$. But, in that case, you need to be looking at $N(0, 4/J)$ instead of $N(0, 1)$. 

For example, when the number of observations is 100 $(J = 100)$,

```{r echo = F, out.width = "50%"}
x <- seq(-4, 4, length = 1000)
y <- dnorm(x, sd = 2 / 10)
plot_data <- data.table(x = x, y = y)
ggplot(data = plot_data) +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y), color = "black")
```

--

.content-box-red[**Reconsider the case 1**]

Suppose you have obtained 100 samples $(J = 100)$ and calculated $\theta$ (sample mean), which turned out to be 2.

Then, your test statistic is $2-1 = 1$. 

Is it unlikely for you to get 1 if the null hypothesis is true? 

The conclusion would be exactly the same as using $\sqrt{J} \times (\theta - \alpha)/2$ because the distribution under the null is adjusted according to the test statistic you use.

--

.content-box-green[**Note**]

We always use normalize test statistic so that we can always look up the same distribution.

# Summary

.content-box-green[**What do we need?**]

+ test-statistic of which we know the distribution (e.g., t-distribution, Normal distribution) assuming the null hypothesis

.content-box-green[**What do we (often) do?**]

+ transform (most of the time) a raw random variable (e.g., sample mean in the example above) into a test statistic of which we know the distribution assuming that the null hypothesis is true
  - e.g., we transformed the sample mean so that it follows the standard Normal distribution.
+ check if the actual number you got from the test statistic is likely to happen or not (formal criteria has not been discussed yet)

# Exercise

You have collected data on annual salary for those who graduated from University A and B. You are interested in testing whether the difference in annual salary between the universities (call it $x$) is not equal 10 on average. You know (for unknown reasons) know that the difference is distributed as $N(\theta, 16)$. 

1. What is the null hypothesis?
2. Under the null hypothesis, what is the distribution of the difference (test-statistic).
3. Normalize the test statistic so that the transformed version follows $N(0, 1)$.
4. The actual difference you observed is 30. What is the probability that you observe a number greater than 30 if the null hypothesis is true? Use `prnom()`.

--

.content-box-green[**Note**]:

In reality, 

+ we need to find out what the distribution of the test statistic is
+ we need to formerly define when we accept or not accept the null hypothesis

# Hypothesis Testing of the Coefficients of a Linear Model

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1000px></html>

---

# Hypothesis Testing of the Coefficients

.content-box-red[**Hypotheses examples**]:

Consider the following model,

$$wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + \beta_2 exper + u$$

+ Hypothesis 1: education has no impact on wage $(\beta_1=0)$

+ Hypothesis 2: experience has a positive impact on wage $(\beta_2>0)$

--

.content-box-red[**Statistical hypothesis testing**]

+ If $\hat{\beta}_1$ is non-random, but just a scalar, all you have to do is just check if $\hat{\beta}_1=0$ or not

--

+ But, the estimate you get is <span style = "color: blue;"> just one realization </span> of the range of values $\hat{\beta}_1$ could take because it is a random varaible

--

+ This means that even if $\beta_1=0$ in the population, it is possible to get an estimate that is very far from 0

--

.content-box-red[**Hypothesis Testing in General**]

You have gotten an estimate of $\beta$ $(\hat{\beta})$ and are wondering if the true value of $\beta$ (which you will never know) is $\alpha$ (a specific constant). 

Here is the underlying concept of hypothesis testing.

+ What would be the .red[distribution] of $\hat{\beta}$ (the estimator) .red[if] the true value of $\beta$ is indeed $\alpha$?

+ If so, how likely that you would have gotten the value you have gotten for $\hat{\beta}$

--

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>

So, let's discuss the distribution of $\beta_j$ now.

---

# Hypothesis Testing: Additional Assumption

So far, we learned that:

+ Expected value of the OLS estimators under MLR.1 ~ MLR.4
+ Variance of the OLS estimators under MLR.1 ~ MLR.5

--

We have .red[NOT] made any assumptions about the distribution of the error term!!

--

In order to perform hypothesis testing, we need to make assumptions about the distribution of error term (this is not strictly true, but more on this later)

--

.content-box-red[**Normality Assumption**]

The population error $u$ is .red[independent] of the explanatory variables $x_1,\dots,x_k$ and is .red[normally] distributed with zero mean and variance $\sigma^2$:

$$u\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$$

--


.content-box-green[**Note**]

The normality assumption is much more than error term being distributed as Normal.

Independence of the error term implies

+ $E[u|x] = 0$
+ $Var[u|x]= \sigma^2$

So, we are necessarily assuming MLR.4 and MLR.5 hold by the independence assumption.

---

# The Implications of All the Assumptions


.content-box-red[**distribution of the dependent variable**]

The distribution of $y$ conditional on $x$ is a Normal distribution

$y|x \sim N(\beta_0+\beta_1 x_1+\dots+\beta_k x_k,\sigma^2)$

+ $E[y|x]$ is $\beta_0+\beta_1 x_1+\dots+\beta_k x_k$
+ $u|x$ is $N(0,\sigma^2)$

--

.content-box-red[**distribution of the OLS estimator**]

If the MLR.1 through MLR.6 are satisfied, $OLS$ estimators are also Normally distributed!

$\hat{\beta}_j \sim N(\beta_j,Var(\hat{\beta}_j))$

which means,

$\frac{\hat{\beta}_j-\beta_j}{se(\hat{\beta}_j)} \sim N(0,1)$

--

Okay, so are we going to use this for testing involving $\beta_j$? 

--

No. 

--

.content-box-red[**t-statistic and t-distribution**]

But, in practice, we need to estimate $sd(\beta_j)$. If we use $\widehat{se(\hat{\beta}_j)}$ instead of $se(\hat{\beta}_j)$, then,

$\frac{\hat{\beta}_j-\beta_j}{\widehat{se(\hat{\beta}_j)}} \sim t_{n-k-1}$

where $n-k-1$ is the degree of freedom of residual.

(Note: $\widehat{se(\hat{\beta}_j)} = \hat{\sigma}^2/\big[SST_X\cdot (1-R_j^2)\big]$)

$\frac{\hat{\beta}_j-\beta_j}{se(\hat{\beta}_j)} \sim N(0, 1)$

So, $[\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{SST_X} - \beta_j]\cdot \frac{SST_X}{\sigma^2}\sim N(0, 1)$ 

<br>

.content-box-green[**Estimated version**]

$\frac{\hat{\beta}_j-\beta_j}{\widehat{se(\hat{\beta}_j)}} \sim t_{n-k-1}$

Suppose the t-statistic you got is 2.16. Then, there's a 3.1% chance you reject the null when it is actually true, if you use it as the critical value. 

--

```{r echo = F, out.width = "60%", dependson = "p-dist"}
g_t_0031
```

So, the lower significance level the null hypothesis is rejected is 3.1%, which is the definition of p-value.

--

.content-box-red[**Decision rule**]

If the p-value is lower than your choice of significance level, then you reject the null. 

This decision rule of course results in the same test results as the one we saw that uses a t-value and critical value.

+ `estimate`: coefficient estimates $(\hat{\beta}_j)$
+ `std.error`: $\widehat{se(\hat{\beta}_j}$)
+ `statistic`: t-statistic for the null of $\beta_j = 0$
+ `p.value`: p-value (for the two sided test with the null of $\beta_j = 0$)

So, for the t-test of of $\beta_j = 0$ is already there. You do not need to do anything further.

For the null hypothesis other than $\beta_j = 0$, you need further work.

# R implementation  (by hand)

Suppose you are testing the null hypothesis of $\beta_{educ} = 1$ against the alternative hypothesis of $\beta_{educ} \ne 1$ (so, this is a two-sided test). 

The t-value for this test is not available from the summary. 

```{r }
#--- coefficient estimate on educ ---#
beta_educ <-
  reg_results_table %>%
  filter(term == "educ") %>%
  pull(estimate)

#--- se of the coefficient on educ ---#
se_beta_educ <-
  reg_results_table %>%
  filter(term == "educ") %>%
  pull(std.error)

#--- get the t-value ---#
(
  t_value <- (beta_educ - 1) / se_beta_educ
)
```

--

The degree of freedom $(n-k-1)$ of the t-distribution can be obtained by applying `degrees_freedom(reg_wage, "resid")`:

```{r }
(
  df_t <- degrees_freedom(reg_wage, "resid")
)
```

--

You can get the 97.5% quantile of the $t_{522}$ using the `qt()` function:

```{r }
(
  critical_value <- qt(0.975, df = df_t)
)
```

--

Since the absolute value of the t-value (`r t_value`) is greater than the critical value (`r critical_value`), you reject the null.

# How to get CI (in general)

.content-box-green[**General Procedure**]:

For the **assumed** distribution of statistic $x$, the $A\%$ confidence interval of $x$ is the range with

+ lower bound: 100 − A/2 percent quantile of $x$
+ upper bound: 100-(100 − A)/2 percent quantile of $x$ 

--

.content-box-green[**Example**]: 

For the 95% CI (A = 95), 

+ lower bound: 2.5 (100 − 95/2) percent quantile of $x$
+ upper bound: 97.5 (100-(100 − 95)/2) percent quantile of $x$

If $x$ follos the standard normal distribution $(x \sim N(0, 1))$, then,

```{r norm-95, include = F}
u <- seq(-3, 3, length = 1000)
pdf <- dnorm(u) # default is mean=0,sd=1
data <- data.table(x = u, y = pdf)

g_norm <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = data, aes(y = y, x = x)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
  )

alpha <- 0.05
c_rej <- qnorm(1 - alpha / 2)
rej_data_high <- data[u >= c_rej, ]
rej_data_low <- data[u <= -c_rej, ]

g_norm_005 <- g_norm +
  geom_ribbon(
    data = rej_data_high,
    aes(ymax = y, ymin = 0, x = x),
    fill = "red", alpha = 0.4
  ) +
  geom_ribbon(
    data = rej_data_low,
    aes(ymax = y, ymin = 0, x = x),
    fill = "red", alpha = 0.4
  ) +
  annotate("text",
    x = c_rej, y = -0.02,
    label = as.character(round(c_rej, digits = 2)),
    size = 4,
    family = "Times"
  ) +
  annotate("text",
    x = 2.5, y = 0.15,
    label = paste("area = ", round(alpha / 2, digits = 3), sep = ""),
    size = 4,
    family = "Times"
  )
```

```{r echo = F, out.width = "60%"}
g_norm_005
```

The 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles are -1.96 and 1.96, respectively.

So, the 95% CI of $x$ is [-1.96, 1.96].

---

# How to get the CI of coefficients

Under the assumption of MLR.1 through MLR.6 (which includes the normality assumption of the error), we learned that

$\frac{\hat{\beta}_j - \beta_j}{\widehat{se(\hat{\beta}_j)}} \sim t_{n-k-1}$

--

So, following the general procedure we discussed in the previous slide, the A% confidence interval of $\frac{\hat{\beta}_j - \beta_j}{\widehat{se(\hat{\beta}_j)}}$ is 

+ lower bound: $(100 − A)/2$% quantile of the $t_{n-k-1}$ distribution (let's call this $Q_l$)
+ upper bound: $100 - (100 − A)/2$% quantile of the $t_{n-k-1}$ distribution (let's call this $Q_h$)  

--

But, we want the A% CI of $\beta_j$, not $\frac{\hat{\beta}_j - \beta_j}{\widehat{se(\hat{\beta}_j)}}$. Solving for $\beta_j$,

$\beta_j = t_{n-k-1}\times \widehat{se(\hat{\beta}_j)} + \hat{\beta}_j$

--

So, to get the A% CI of $\beta_j$, we scale the CI of $\frac{\hat{\beta}_j - \beta_j}{\widehat{se(\hat{\beta}_j)}}$ by $se(\hat{\beta}_j)$ and then shift by $\hat{\beta}_j$.

+ lower bound: $Q_l \times se(\hat{\beta}_j) + \hat{\beta}_j$ 
+ lower bound: $Q_h \times se(\hat{\beta}_j) + \hat{\beta}_j$

Note that $Q_l$ is negative and $Q_h$ is negative.

# CI: An Example (Cont.)

We are interested in getting the 90% confidence interval of the coefficient on `educ` $(\beta_{educ})$.

Under all the assumptions (MLR.1 through MLR.6), we know that in general,

$\frac{\hat{\beta}_{educ} - \beta_{educ}}{\widehat{se(\hat{\beta}_{educ})}} \sim t_{n-k-1}$

--

Specifically for this regression,

+ $\hat{\beta}_{educ}$ = `r wage_reg_coef %>% filter(term == 'educ') %>% pull(estimate)`

+ $\widehat{se(\hat{\beta}_{educ})}$ = `r wage_reg_coef %>% filter(term == 'educ') %>% pull(std.error)`

+ $n - k - 1 = `r df`$

```{r include = F}
u <- seq(-3, 3, length = 1000)
df <- degrees_freedom(wage_reg, "resid")
pdf <- dt(u, df = df) # default is mean=0,sd=1
data <- data.table(x = u, y = pdf)

g_t <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = data, aes(y = y, x = x)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +

rej_data_high <- data[u >= c_rej, ]
rej_data_low <- data[u <= -c_rej, ]

  geom_ribbon(

    aes(ymax = y, ymin = 0, x = x),
    fill = "red", alpha = 0.4

# CI: An Example (Cont.)

Here is the distribution of $t_{522}$:

```{r echo = F, out.width = "60%", fig.dim = c(4,2)}
g_t_005
```

--

Now, we need to find the 5% ((100-90)/2) and 95% (100-(100-90)/2) quantile of $t_{522}$.

```{r }
qt(0.05, df = 522)
```

```{r }
qt(0.95, df = 522)
```

Yes, we could have just gotten one of them and multiply it by -1 to get the other since t distribution is symmetric around 0.

--

So, the 90% CI of $\frac{0.599 - \beta_{educ}}{0.051} \sim t_{522}$ is [`r qt(0.05, df = 522)`, `r qt(0.95, df = 522)`]

--

By scaling and shifting, the lower and upper bounds of the 90% CI of $\beta_{educ}$ are:

+ lower bound: 0.599 + 0.051 $\times$ `r qt(0.05, df = 522)` = `r 0.599 + 0.051 * qt(0.05, df = 522)`

+ upper bound: 0.599 + 0.051 $\times$ `r qt(0.95, df = 522)` = `r 0.599 + 0.051 * qt(0.95, df = 522)`

# Linear Combination of Multiple Coefficients

.content-box-green[**Example**]

$$log(wage) = \beta_0+\beta_1 jc+ \beta_2 univ + \beta_3 exper + u$$

+ $jc$: 1 if you attended 2-year college, 0 otherwise
+ $univ$: 1 if you attended 4-year college, 0 otherwise

--

Does the impact of education on wage is greater if you attend a 4-year college than 2-year college?

--

The null and alternative hypotheses would be:

+ $H_1:$ $\beta_1 < \beta_2$
+ $H_0:$ $\beta_1 = \beta_2$

--

Rewriting them,

+ $H_1:$ $\beta_1-\beta_2 < 0$
+ $H_0:$ $\beta_1 - \beta_2 =0$

--

Or,  

+ $H_1:$ $\alpha < 0$
+ $H_0:$ $\alpha =0$

where $\alpha = \beta_1 - \beta_2$

Note that $\alpha$ is a linear combination of $\beta_1$ and  $\beta_2$.

---

# Linear Combination of Multiple Coefficients

.content-box-green[**Important fact**]

For any linear combination of the OLS coefficients, denoted as $\hat{\alpha}$, the following holds:

$$\frac{\hat{\alpha}-\alpha}{\widehat{se(\hat{\alpha})}} \sim t_{n-k-1}$$

Where $\alpha$ is the true value (it is $\beta_1 - \beta_2$ in the example in the previous slide).

--

So, using the example, this means that 

$$\frac{\hat{\alpha}-\alpha}{\widehat{se(\hat{\alpha})}} = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1-\hat{\beta}_2-(\beta_1 - \beta_2)}{\widehat{se(\hat{\beta}_1-\hat{\beta}_2)}} \sim t_{n-k-1}$$

--

This is great because we know how to do t-test!

--

.content-box-green[**Going back to the example**]

Our null hypothesis is $\alpha = 0$ (or $\beta_1 - \beta_2 = 0$).

So, .red[If] indeed the null hypothesis is true, then

$$\frac{\hat{\alpha}-0}{\widehat{se(\hat{\alpha})}} = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1-\hat{\beta}_2-0}{\widehat{se(\hat{\beta}_1-\hat{\beta}_2)}} \sim t_{n-k-1}$$

--

So, all you need to do is to substitute $\hat{\beta}_1$, $\hat{\beta}_2$, $\widehat{se(\hat{\beta}_1 - \hat{\beta}_2)}$ into the formula and see if the value is beyond the critical value for your chosen level of statistical significance.

---

# Linear Combination of Multiple Coefficients

But, 

$$se(\hat{\beta}_1-\hat{\beta}_2)= \sqrt{Var(\hat{\beta}_1-\hat{\beta}_2}) \ne \sqrt{Var(\hat{\beta}_1)+Var(\hat{\beta}_2)}$$

--

If the following was true,

$$se(\hat{\beta}_1-\hat{\beta}_2) = \sqrt{Var(\hat{\beta}_1)+Var(\hat{\beta}_2)}$$

then, we could have just extracted $Var(\hat{\beta}_1)$ and $Var(\hat{\beta}_2)$ individually from the regression object on R, sum them up, and take a square root of it.

--

.content-box-green[**Math Aside**]

$$Var(ax+by) = a^2 Var(x) + 2abCov(x,y) + b^2 Var(y)$$

--

So, 

$$se(\hat{\beta}_1-\hat{\beta}_2)= \sqrt{Var(\hat{\beta}_1-\hat{\beta}_2}) = \sqrt{Var(\hat{\beta}_1)-2Cov(\hat{\beta}_1,\hat{\beta}_2)+Var(\hat{\beta}_2)}$$

```{r }

None of the coefficients on `bavg`, `hrunsyr`, and `rbisyr` is statistically significantly different from 0 even at the 10% level!!

Consider a following general model:

$$
y = \beta_0 +\beta_1 x_1 + \dots+\beta_k x_k +u

Suppose we have $q$ restrictions to test: that is, the null hypothesis states that $q$ of the variables have zero coefficients.

$$H_0: \beta_{k-q+1} =0, \beta_{k-q+2} =0, \dots, \beta_k=0$$

When we impose the restrictions under $H_0$, the restricted model is the following:

$$y = \beta_0 +\beta_1 x_1 + \dots+\beta_{k-q} x_{k-q} + u$$


.content-box-red[**F-statistic**]

.content-box-green[**Questions**]

+ Is the above $F$-statistic always positive?

As you can see, `brunsyr` and `hrunsyr` are highly correlated with each other. 

They are not so highly correlated with `bavg`.

# F-test (easier way)

You can use the `linearHypothesis()` function from the `car` package. 

.content-box-red[**Syntax**]

```{r eval = F}
linearHypothesis(regression, hypothesis)
```

`regression` is the name of the regression results of the unrestricted model

`hypothesis` is a text of null hypothesis:


.content-box-green[**example**]

`c("x1 = 0", "x2 = 1")` means the coefficients on $x1$ and $x2$ are $0$ and $1$, respectively


.content-box-red[**Demonstration**]

```{r }
#--- load the car package ---#
library(car)

#--- unrestricted regression ---#
reg_u <- feols(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = data)

#--- F-test ---#
linearHypothesis(reg_u, c("x1=0", "x2=0"))
```

# Multiple coefficients again

+ The test of a linear combination of the parameters we looked at earlier is a special case where the number of restriction is 1. 

+ It can be shown that square root of $F_{1, df}$ follows the $t_{df}$ distribution.

+ So, we can actually use $F$-test for this type of hypothesis testing because $F_{1,t-n-k} \sim t_{t-n-k}^2$.

```{r }
#--- OLS with lm() ---#
reg_sc <- feols(lwage ~ jc + univ + exper, data = twoyear) # OLS

#--- F-test ---#
F_test <- linearHypothesis(reg_sc, c("jc-univ=0"))

#--- t-statistic ---#
sqrt(F_test$Chisq[2])
```

Check with the previous slide of the same t-test and confirm that the t-statistics we got there and here are the same.
